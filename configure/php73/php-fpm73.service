# Sets up a new /dev namespace for the executed processes and only adds API pseudo devices
# such as /dev/null, /dev/zero or /dev/random (as well as the pseudo TTY subsystem) to it,

# Kernel variables accessible through /proc/sys, /sys, /proc/sysrq-trigger, /proc/latency_stats,
# /proc/acpi, /proc/timer_stats, /proc/fs and /proc/irq will be made read-only to all processes
# of the unit. Usually, tunable kernel variables should only be written at boot-time, with the
# sysctl.d(5) mechanism. Almost no services need to write to these at runtime; it is hence
# recommended to turn this on for most services.

# The Linux Control Groups (cgroups(7)) hierarchies accessible through /sys/fs/cgroup will be
